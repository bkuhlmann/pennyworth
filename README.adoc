== Setup

=== Production

To install, run:

[source,bash]
----
gem install pennyworth
----

=== Development

To contribute, run:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/bkuhlmann/pennyworth.git

----

[source,bash]
----
bin/console
----

== Usage

=== Command Line Interface (CLI)

From the command line, type: pennyworth

....
pennyworth -c, [--config]        # Manage gem configuration.
pennyworth -h, [--help=COMMAND]  # Show this message or get help for a command.
pennyworth -i, [--install]       # Install Alfred Workflows.
pennyworth -s, [--string=VALUE]  # Manipulate strings.
pennyworth -v, [--version]       # Show gem version.
....

For string options, type: pennyworth help string

....
-d, [--downcase], [--no-downcase]    # Downcase string.
-u, [--upcase], [--no-upcase]        # Upcase string.
-t, [--titleize], [--no-titleize]    # Capitalize each word and delimit with space or forward slash.
-c, [--camelcase], [--no-camelcase]  # Capitalize each word and delimit with nothing or double colon.
-s, [--snakecase], [--no-snakecase]  # Downcase each word and delimit with underscore or forward slash.
-s, [--size], [--no-size]            # Calculate string size.
....

While the command line options are nice, the real power comes from running the following command:
`pennyworth -i`. This command installs the Alfred Workflows to support this gem. You can use the
Alfred commands provided by each workflow instead of the CLI. Check each workflows documentation for
details by opening Alfred preferences and clicking on the _Workflows_ tab. Each workflow associated
with this gem is prefixed with _Pennyworth_.

=== Customization

This gem can be configured via a global configuration:

....
~/.config/pennyworth/configuration.yml
....

It can also be configured via link:https://www.alchemists.io/projects/xdg[XDG] environment
variables.

The default configuration is as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
:alfred_settings_root: "/Users/bkuhlmann/Dropbox/Cache/Alfred/Alfred.alfredpreferences"
----

Feel free to take this default configuration, modify, and save as your own custom
`configuration.yml`.
