A command line interface that augments link:https://www.alfredapp.com[Alfred] workflows.

toc::[]

== Features

* Adds Ruby support to link:https://www.alfredapp.com[Alfred].
* Supports building advanced link:https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows[Workflows] for personal
  augmentation.

== Screencast

video::https://www.alchemists.io/videos/projects/pennyworth/demo.mp4[poster=https://www.alchemists.io/images/projects/pennyworth/demo.png,width=700,height=636,role=focal_point]

== Requirements

. link:https://www.apple.com/macos[macOS]
. link:https://www.gnu.org/software/bash[Bash]
. link:https://www.alfredapp.com[Alfred]
. link:https://www.alfredapp.com/purchase[Alfred Powerpack]
. {frum_link}
. link:https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby]

== Setup

To install, run:

[source,bash]
----
gem install pennyworth
----

When using the `--git_hub` CLI option, you'll want to supply your GitHub login and
link:https://github.com/settings/tokens[Personal Access Token] with at least _read_ access via the
following environment variables:

[source,bash]
----
GITHUB_API_LOGIN=
GITHUB_API_TOKEN=
----

You can configure these environment variables via link:https://direnv.net[direnv] if using the CLI
or through the link:https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/advanced/variables/#environment[Alfred
Workflow Environment].

‚ö†Ô∏è When using Alfred Workflow environment variables, please ensure you check the _Don't Export_
option for these variables so you don't expose your credentials when exporting/sharing workflows
with others.

== Usage

=== Command Line Interface (CLI)

From the command line, type `pennyworth` to view usage:

....
USAGE:
  -c, --config ACTION                      Manage gem configuration. Actions: edit || view.
      --encodings                          Render Alfred encodings script filter.
      --git_hub                            Render Alfred GitHub repositories script filter.
  -h, --help                               Show this message.
      --http_statuses                      Render Alfred HTTP statuses script filter.
      --ruby_gems                          Render Alfred RubyGems script filter.
      --system_errors                      Render Alfred system errors script filter.
      --system_signals                     Render Alfred system signals script filter.
      --text CONTENT                       Render Alfred text script filter.
  -v, --version                            Show gem version.

GITHUB OPTIONS:
      --organization [HANDLE]              Set organization. Default: "".
      --user [HANDLE]                      Set user. Default: "".

RUBYGEMS OPTIONS:
      --owner [HANDLE]                     Set owner. Default: "".
....

The following demonstrates how to use Pennyworth from the CLI or within an Alfred Script Filter:

[source,bash]
----
pennyworth --config edit
pennyworth --config view

pennyworth --encodings

pennyworth --git_hub --organization alchemists
pennyworth --git_hub --user bkuhlmann

pennyworth --http_statuses
pennyworth --ruby_gems --owner bkuhlmann
pennyworth --system_errors
pennyworth --system_signals

pennyworth --text demo
pennyworth --text "An Example"
----

While the command line options are nice, the real power comes from using Pennyworth in conjunction
with link:https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/inputs/script-filter/json[Alfred Script Filters].
Without having Alfred wired up to consume the CLI output, you'll only get a JSON in your console. To
explain better, continue reading or skip ahead to the _Workflows_ section.

=== Customization

This gem can be configured via a global configuration:

....
~/.config/pennyworth/configuration.yml
....

It can also be configured via link:https://www.alchemists.io/projects/xdg[XDG] environment
variables.

The default configuration is as follows:

[source,yaml]

directly].

=== Workflows

Not all workflows require Pennyworth to run properly. For the workflows that _do_ require Pennyworth
support, the following assumptions are made:

1. Your link:https://www.alchemists.io/projects/dotfiles[Dotfiles] are configured to use
   link:https://www.gnu.org/software/bash[Bash] and load your environment appropriately. Bash is not
   a hard requirement, though. You can use _any shell_ you are comfortable with as long as you teach
   Alfred to load your development environment before running the Alfred Workflow.
2. You have the latest version of Alfred, Ruby, and Pennyworth installed.
3. You are using a Ruby version manager, like {frum_link}, which ensures Ruby is on your load path.

With the above requirements in mind, the following sections document how to download and install all
Pennyworth workflows that are compatible with Alfred. Should you want to tweak any of these
workflows, you'd only need to edit an existing workflow or build your own with these settings:

image:https://www.alchemists.io/images/projects/pennyworth/screenshots/script_filter.png[Script Filter,width=776,height=635,role=focal_point]

Before diving into each workflow, I want to highlight that the following capabilities are available
to all workflows depending on what kind of item is currently selected within the Alfred UI:

* `SHIFT` or `COMMAND + y` will launch
  link:https://www.alfredapp.com/help/features/previews[Quicklook] for any URL based workflow.
* `ENTER` or `COMMAND + c` will copy selections to clipboard (depends on context, though).
* `COMMAND + l` will launch link:https://www.alfredapp.com/help/features/large-type[Large Type] of
  current selection.
* `ENTER` Will either copy selection to clipboard or launch URL in default web browser.

== Architecture

The following documents the workfow used to process all actions from Alfred.

image::https://www.alchemists.io/images/projects/pennyworth/doc/architecture.svg[Architecture Diagram]

== Troubleshooting

* link:https://github.com/ruby/psych[Psych] 4.0.0 has a
  link:https://github.com/ruby/psych/issues/490[bug] which prevents loading of YAML configurations
  that use symbols as keys. If you get caught by this, please upgrade to Psych 4.0.1 for the fix.
* When your Alfred Workflow yields no output, you might want to open the
  link:https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/utilities/debug[Alfred Debugger], rerun your
  workflow, and check for errors. You can also jump to the CLI and run Pennyworth directly.
* If you get GitHub authorization errors, make sure you have defined the appropriate credentials
  (mentioned earlier) for both within your shell where you are running Pennyworth or within the
  Alfred Workflow environment.

== Development

To contribute, run:

[source,bash]
----
