= Pennyworth

Pennyworth is a command line interface and the perfect companion to
link:https://www.alfredapp.com[Alfred]. With Pennyworth, you can unlock the full potential of the
Ruby language by leveraging a modern version of Ruby through Alfred Workflows. Perfect for when you
want to advance beyond the basic workflows Alfred provides by default.

toc::[]

== Features

* Adds Ruby support to link:https://www.alfredapp.com[Alfred].
* Supports building advanced link:https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows[Workflows] for personal
  augmentation.

== Screencast

video::https://alchemists.io/videos/projects/pennyworth/demo.mp4[poster=https://alchemists.io/images/projects/pennyworth/demo.png,width=706,height=632,role=focal_point]

== Requirements

. link:https://www.apple.com/macos[macOS]
. {bash_link}
. link:https://www.alfredapp.com[Alfred]
. link:https://www.alfredapp.com/purchase[Alfred Powerpack]
. link:https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby]

While using a {ruby_version_managers_link} is not a hard requirement, it is strongly encouraged since a version manager will give you the freedom to toggle between different Ruby versions since this gem has strict Ruby version requirements (especially in regards to using a modern version of Ruby).

All of the workflows, scripts, examples for this gem use {bash_link} syntax. That said, if you are comfortable with translating Bash syntax to your shell syntax of choice, you can make this gem work in different shells too. That is beyond the scope of this document, though, so leave that exercise up to you.

== Setup

To install _with_ security, run:

[source,bash]
----
# 💡 Skip this line if you already have the public certificate installed.
gem cert --add <(curl --compressed --location https://alchemists.io/gems.pem)
gem install pennyworth --trust-policy HighSecurity
----

To install _without_ security, run:

[source,bash]
----
gem install pennyworth
----

When using the `--git_hub` CLI option, you'll want to supply your GitHub login and
link:https://github.com/settings/tokens[Personal Access Token] with at least _read_ access via the
following environment variables:

[source,bash]
----
GITHUB_API_LOGIN=
GITHUB_API_TOKEN=
----

You can configure these environment variables via link:https://direnv.net[direnv] if using the CLI
or through the link:https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/advanced/variables/#environment[Alfred
Workflow Environment].

⚠️ When using Alfred Workflow environment variables, please ensure you check the _Don't Export_
option for these variables so you don't expose your credentials when exporting/sharing workflows
with others.

== Usage

=== Command Line Interface (CLI)

From the command line, type `pennyworth` to view usage:

....
USAGE
  sublime_text_kit [OPTIONS]
  sublime_text_kit COMMAND [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS
  --encodings                Render Alfred encodings script filter.
  --http_statuses            Render Alfred HTTP statuses script filter.
  --ruby_gems [HANDLE]       Render Alfred RubyGems script filter.
                             Default: bkuhlmann.
  --standard_gems [KIND]     Render Alfred Standard Gems script filter.
                             Use: all, default, or bundled.
                             Default: all.
  --standard_errors          Render Alfred standard errors script filter.
  --system_errors            Render Alfred system errors script filter.
  --system_signals           Render Alfred system signals script filter.
  --text CONTENT             Render Alfred text script filter.
  -v, --version              Show version.
  -h, --help [COMMAND]       Show this message.

COMMANDS
  config                     Manage configuration.
                             Path is dynamic per current directory.
  git_hub                    Render Alfred GitHub repositories script filter.
....

While the command line options are nice, the real power comes from using Pennyworth in conjunction
with link:https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/inputs/script-filter/json[Alfred Script Filters].
Without having Alfred wired up to consume the CLI output, you'll only get a JSON in your console. To
explain better, continue reading or skip ahead to the _Workflows_ section.

=== Customization

This gem can be configured via a global configuration:

....
~/.config/pennyworth/configuration.yml
....

It can also be configured via link:https://alchemists.io/projects/xdg[XDG] environment
variables.

=== Workflows

Not all workflows require Pennyworth to run properly (see the _Other_ section below for details).
For the workflows that _do_ require Pennyworth support, the following assumptions are made:

1. Your link:https://alchemists.io/projects/dotfiles[Dotfiles] are configured to use {bash_link} and load your environment appropriately. Bash is not a hard requirement, though. You can use _any shell_ you are comfortable with as long as you teach Alfred to load your development environment before running the Alfred Workflow.
2. You have the latest version of Alfred, Ruby, and Pennyworth installed.
3. You are using a {ruby_version_managers_link} which ensures Ruby is on your load path. As mentioned in the _Requirements_ section above, this is not a hard requirement so if you have the correct version of Ruby required by this gem on your path, that'll work too.

With the above requirements in mind, the following sections document how to download and install all
Pennyworth workflows that are compatible with Alfred. Should you want to tweak any of these
workflows, you'd only need to edit an existing workflow or build your own with these settings:

image:https://alchemists.io/images/projects/pennyworth/screenshots/script_filter.png[Script Filter,width=776,height=635,role=focal_point]

Before diving into each workflow, I want to highlight that the following capabilities are available
to all workflows depending on what kind of item is currently selected within the Alfred UI:

* `SHIFT` or `COMMAND + y` will launch
  link:https://www.alfredapp.com/help/features/previews[Quicklook] for any URL based workflow.
* `ENTER` or `COMMAND + c` will copy selections to clipboard (depends on context, though).
* `COMMAND + l` will launch link:https://www.alfredapp.com/help/features/large-type[Large Type] of
  current selection.
* `ENTER` Will either copy selection to clipboard or launch URL in default web browser.

=== Troubleshooting

* When your Alfred Workflow yields no output, you might want to open the
  link:https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/utilities/debug[Alfred Debugger], rerun your
  workflow, and check for errors. You can also jump to the CLI and run Pennyworth directly.
* If you get GitHub authorization errors, make sure you have defined the appropriate credentials
  (mentioned earlier) for both within your shell where you are running Pennyworth or within the
  Alfred Workflow environment.
